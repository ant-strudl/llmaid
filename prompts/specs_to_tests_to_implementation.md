I have a specification file for upcoming feature in my LLMAid project. Please:

1. Analyze the existing project structure, source code, and testing patterns
2. Implement any missing tests first based on the specification
3. Watch the new tests fail
4. Each test function should mirror exactly one scenario from the spec and include the scenario description as a docstring
5. If you think additional scenarios would improve coverage, do not implement them directly. Instead, suggest them in chat. If there is no test file for current spec file, create one. Do not modify existing tests unless necessary.
6. Implement any missing functionality needed to support the new feature and make the tests pass. Implement everything needed to make these tests pass, including any missing error classes, validation logic, and functionality itself. Structure the output as a complete implementation with file paths clearly marked.
7. Follow the existing code style and testing patterns in the project
8. Make sure all tests are properly structured with Given/When/Then comments matching the spec
