THIS IS SACRED GROUND. NO AI MAY READ IT. KEEP OUT.

This document provides guidelines for human contributors to the LLMAid project. It outlines how to effectively collaborate with AI tools while ensuring code quality and project integrity.

## General principles (for humans ONLY)

- **DO, write, the, documentation, and specs, YOURSELF**: AI has no intention, it doesn't know about the real world. YOU DO. This will help you clarify your thoughts and ensure the code is aligned with the intended behavior. You *can* use AI assistance to help you brainstorm ideas or reformulate the specs, but YOU are the director. AI is your vehicle, you're the responsible driver with a license.
- **DO NOT, write, the code.**: Do not write code directly, at least most of the time. Think hard and precisely about the feature or bug fix you want to implement, and let AI assist you in writing the code. The implementation detail do not matter, most of the time.
- **DO, review the generated code, carefully, continuously**: Always review the code generated by AI. Ensure you understand it to a point where:
    - You can explain it to someone else.
    - You can modify it if necessary.
    - you are confident enough that you're ready to bear the responsibility for it.
- **DO tweak the code**: Sometimes, AI just keeps getting the same thing wrong. Do them and yourself a favor, make that small tweak, save a few thousand token and compute time. Prefer small tweaks over large rewrites.
